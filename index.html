<div>
<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
<li> <span class="lt"> Ess is not neccesary</span> <span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
<li id="td">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
<div class="ls">
<ul>

<li> Inline by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl Internal by using a style element in the head section</li>
<li>External by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
<li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
   <span class="bgb">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.

<br>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element
<br>
<br>
There is a wide range selectors avlaible. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID .Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
